- check remix cause it seems like it would solve all ur problems lol 

- remix (react router v7) or next 

    = maintainability wise: next 
    (more likely to find someone who works with next rather tan remix)
    = seo benefits: next
    (idk ppl be saying stuff)
    = requirements wise: remix
    (it does exactly what we want while also keeping it fairly high performative
    simpler than next )

- remix solving client state management (not rlly required since we will use a state manager
anyways but its worth looking into)
